# Project Description

Baron et al., determined the distinct subpopulations of pancreatic cells and characterized them by using transcriptomics data generated by single cell sequencing using inDrops protocol from 12000 human and mouse pancreatic cells. This project aims to reproduce the findings by Baron et al. 

This repository has the commands and code that was used to analyse the single cell sequencing data from a 51 year old female donor. This dataset was obtained from the article by Baron et al (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27667365/).
